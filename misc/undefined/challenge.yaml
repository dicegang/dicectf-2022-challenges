  I was writing some Javascript when everything became undefined...

  Can you create something out of nothing and read the flag at `/flag.txt`? Tested for Node version 17.
  
  `${nc_main_0}`
flag: dice{who_needs_builtins_when_you_have_arguments}

provide:
- ./index.js

containers:
  main:
    build: .
    replicas: 2
    ports:
      - 5000
    securityContext:
      privileged: true

expose:
  main:
  - target: 5000
    tcp: 31131
    healthContent: What do you want to run?
